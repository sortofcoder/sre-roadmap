# SRE Roadmap

An opinionated roadmap to become an SRE (Concepts > Tools)


## Distributed systems

    | Feature | Event Log  | Message Queue | 
    | :-------------| :------------- | :------------- |
    |   Purpose  | Record system events |	Facilitate asynchronous communication |
    | Content | What happened, timestamps |	Data, instructions, notifications |
    | Processing |	Analyzed later, not immediate |	Processed by consumers as they become ready |
